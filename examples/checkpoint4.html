        <!-- In order to fully utilize Bootstrap, we'll have to organize our HTML in a new way. -->

        <!-- At the top should be the navbar. This "nav" element alongside adding Bootstrap classes will help us to do this. -->
        <!-- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/ for reference! -->

        <!-- In order for bootstrap to work, we have to add specific classes to tell it how to style our elements. -->
        <!-- In this case, we need the "navbar" class to tell it it is a navbar -->
        <!-- "navbar-expand-lg" means that on large screens, we should see the full navbar (dw about this- its Bootstrap magic.) -->
        <!-- The "navbar-light" tells it it needs to be light colored -->
        <!-- And the "bg-light" also sets the background to light -->
        <!-- All without any CSS!!! -->
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">

            <!-- Now we need to add a container. Everything in Bootstrap should ideally be in a "container" div -->
            <!-- This allows Bootstrap to automatically resize things so they look good on your phone too! -->
            <!-- You can either use "container" which is fixed-width, or "container-fluid" which will "fill" your screen! -->
            <!-- In this case, we'll use "container-fluid" -->
            <div class="container-fluid">

                <!-- We'll introduce another element here, "span" -->
                <!-- "span" is identical to "div", but it doesn't break lines like "div" does -->
                <!-- This makes it ideal for text that doesn't need a line break, like here! -->

                <!-- We can find these bootstrap classes in the example link above, by the way! -->
                <!-- In any case, navbar-brand tells Bootstrap this is the title of our Navbar -->
                <!-- mb-0 sets the (m)argin (b)ottom to 0. (Yes, you can easily set margin or padding using m/p-#!) -->
                <!-- And "h1" styles the text the same way an h1 element would! -->
                <span class="navbar-brand mb-0 h1">ProCo.</span>

                <!-- Don't worry too much about this- just know that we need it. You can actually just copy direct from the examples at Bootstrap! -->
                <!-- In case you are curious, this allows for a mobile-friendly experience by collapsing the whole navbar on a phone! -->

                <!-- We need to create a div that tells us what will collapse on a mobile phone. -->
                <!-- In this case, its copied direct from bootstrap, so don't worry. It's totally fine to copy their code as long as you don't claim it as your own! -->
                <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarText">

                    <!-- Okay, sorry about having to sweep some Bootstrap magic under the rug for now, but let's go back to things you should understand. -->

                        <!-- Likewise, "nav-item" tells Bootstrap this is an item in the navbar -->

                            <!-- "active" lets us know we are actually on this page right now. -->
                            <!-- We use href="#" to link to the current page- it's a neat trick! -->
                            <a class="nav-link active" href="#">Home</a>
