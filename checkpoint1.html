<!-- This is the !DOCTYPE tag. It tells the web browser this is an HTML file-->
<!-- While not *strictly* necessary, it is still good practice -->
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<!-- This is the HTML tag. Note that almost every tag in html has a start tag and end tag -->
<!-- The start tag tells where the element begins, and the end tells where it ends -->
<!-- The end tag also includes a handy "/" to let you know it is an end tag -->
<!-- Tags are how HTML works, as we'll see. The "html" tag tells us where the all websites contents will fit -->
<html>

    <!-- This is the "head" tag. It tells us about the stuff about the webpage that isn't directly seen -->
    <!-- There is a bunch of complex tags we could put in here, but for now lets keep it simple. -->
    <head>

        <!-- This is the "title" tag. This tells the web browser what to display in the "tab" section -->
        <!-- Remember, since its in the "head", it won't be displayed ON the web page, but above it! -->
        <title>
            Checkpoint #1 
        </title>
        <!-- We can just type our content in between the tags! How neat.-->

        <!-- Okay, we'll introduce you to script and link tags later. Let's get a basic website up first! -->

    </head>

    <!-- Note the "nesting" structure of tags. This helps us to organize them and place our elements where we want them -->
    <!-- In this case, notice the "body" tag is NOT inside the "head" tag, but actually just after it. It's inside the "html"! -->
    <!-- Can you guess what goes in the "body" tag? -->
    <!-- That's right! Everything that we see exactly ON our webpage, we put inside the "body" -->
    <body>

        <!-- Here's an important tag, "h1". "h#", where # is a number 1-6, is a tag that denotes a "header" -->
        <!-- 1 is the most important (think largest, boldest), and 6 is the least. You should use them in this order -->
        <!-- The "h#" tags are usually reserved for titles or...headers. Use them wisely, as Google likes to find these to list your site better -->
        <h1>Checkpoint #1</h1>
        <h2>Here's how a smaller header looks, by the way.</h2>

        <!-- Next up is the "p" tag. This is mainly used for text, and stands for paragraph! -->
        <!-- It's a very basic tag, but we'll learn to spice it up later -->
        <p>My first website!</p>

        <!-- And there we go! We have our first website. We'll learn a few more crucial tags in Checkpoint #2. -->

    </body>

</html> <!-- Here is the end tag from above! -->
